# What happens to hybrids?
## Success!
#### F1 Heterosis
* Dominance
* Over-dominance
* Synergistic interactions between loci
* Short lived for segregating introgressed lineages.
  
#### Long term success 
* Depends on favourable combinations of parental alleles.
* Favourable interactions
* Additive increaces to fitness
* Purging of deleterious alleles and mutation load.
