# What happens to hybrids?
## Failiure!

#### Wright's view.
  _Selection favours genes interacting to produce a favourable effect._

#### Fisher's view.
  _Selection acts on individual genes, which increace fitness on average across many genetic backgrounds._
  
#### Hybrid incompatibility

* A side effect of divergence between lineages.

* Dobzansky and Muller provided a model of hybrid incompatibility.

* Observed in _Drosophila_, _Helianthus_, _Iris_.
