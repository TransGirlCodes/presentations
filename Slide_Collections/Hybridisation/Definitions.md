## What is Hybridisation?

* Mixing, through sexual reproduction, two animals or plants of different breeds, varieties, species or genera.

## What is Introgression?

* The transfer of of genetic information (DNA or RNA) from one species/OTU/race/biotype, into another. This occurs through hybridisation followed by a repeated backcrossing.

* It results in a much more complex mix of genes from parents, than simple hybridisation.
