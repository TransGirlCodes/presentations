# Enter Julia

- Write entire program / workflow in one language (Julia)
- If you want to improve performance
  - Profile and find slow bits
  - Write that bit of Julia better!
- If you want to get even MOAR POWAR!
  - Find areas which might be easily done in parallel
  - Parallelise them (still using Julia code only)
  - Often the same coding pattern for multi-core, cluster, and cloud
  - GPU Packages available to let Julia use them.
  
Ok this sounds great! I wanna do my bioinformatics with this language!
