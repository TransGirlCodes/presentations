# Designing and implementing

* Inputs
  * Accepted consensus sequences from alignments to reference.

* Efficiency
  * Made use of efficient Bioconductor sequence types.

* Four taxon tests. 
  * Equations adapted from previous studies.
    * Possible to distinguish direction of gene flow.
  
* Detection and Dating
  * Sliding window analysis combined and Binomial probability distribution.
    * Over time introgressed regions will accumulate mutations and break up.
    * Rapid dating possible by finding the root of the binomial CDF.
