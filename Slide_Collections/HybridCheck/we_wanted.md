# HybridCheck

1. Identify evidence for introgression at genome level
   * Four Taxon Tests

2. Identify putative recombinant blocks
   * Triplet Scanning Method

3. Assess significance of recombinant blocks
   * Based on probability of observing mutations

4. Provide a rapid dating estimate of the blocks
   * Simple mutation and divergence model

And create some cool charts along the way

Usable from R console or as a web application.
