# Future directions

* Version 2
  * A refactor of design.
  * More extensible and modular.
  * Allowing swapping and changeing of methods.
  * But a uniform API.
    
    _Global Test -> Finding regions -> Testing regions -> Dating regions -> Downstream analysis_
      
* Improvements on detection and dating.
  * Older events more difficult to date accurately.
  * Fragmentation of old blocks = loss of age telling mutations.
  
* Performance
  * Potential move to Julia and BioJulia framework instead of R.
