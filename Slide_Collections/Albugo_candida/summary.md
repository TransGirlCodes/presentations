# Summary

* Obligate biotrophic pathogens are expected to specialize.

* Specialists are presumably "on the road to speciation".

* _Albugo candida_ is a generalist obligate biotroph.

* It has evolved to become generalist through hybridisation, of specialized host-specific races.  

* Immune suppression of the host allows two different races to meet.
